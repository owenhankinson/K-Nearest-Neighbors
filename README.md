# K-Nearest-Neighbors
As a project for school, I had to take psudocode and a dataset, and create my own version of the K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm. Uses the distance formula to calculate the distance between a given point and the rest of the points in the data set, then appends that point data and its data to a dictionary. Using the parameter "K" I deduce the k-amount of points that have the smallest distance to the point, then the classifying is up to whatever majority is favored!

This was a really fun school project to work on the further understand what happens behind the K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm and it was a great test taster to see if I was going to enjoy ML. That answer is an astounding YES!
